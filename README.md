Stanford Machine Learning Specialization
This specialization consists of 3 courses taught by Andrew Ng, an AI visionary at Stanford University, and is in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online. 

Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning - Regression and Classification
•	Linear regression, logistic regression, cost function, gradient descent
•	Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy & Scikit-learn
•	Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks, including linear regression & logistic regression

Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms
•	Neural networks, activation functions, decision trees
•	Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
•	Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real world
•	Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning
•	Clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems
•	Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection
•	Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method
•	Build a deep reinforcement learning model
