## Stanford Machine Learning Specialization
Consists of 3 courses taught by Andrew Ng, in collaboration with DeepLearning.AI and Stanford Online

### Course 1: Supervised Machine Learning - Regression and Classification

- Linear regression, logistic regression, cost function, gradient descent
- Build & train supervised machine learning models using NumPy & Scikit-learn

  
### Course 2: Advanced Learning Algorithms

- Neural networks, activation functions, decision trees
- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees


### Course 3: Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

- Clustering, anomaly detection, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model
